# Olympics

# Project motivation and description
I have always been interested in the Olympics and love watching all the different sports (I am hoping to go to Paris to hopefully witness some events in person this year!). Having watched many different athletes win and lose at many different disciplines, I am wondering whether there are any trends in who wins / loses and whether we can predict which athletes will go on to win a medal. 

# Questions
1. What are the most successful countries per edition of the Olympics?
2. Has the proportion of female athletes and proportion of medals won by women changed over time since 1974?
3. Are there more medals available for certain sports compared to others?
4. What is the distribution of athlete's age, height, and weight for those that do and do not win a medal?
5. Can we use the features sex, country, sport, age, height, and weight to predict whether someone has won a medal or not?

# Outcomes
- This project gives a thorough description of some of the characteristics of Olympic athletes between 1974-2020, including the best-performing countries and the proportion of female athletes.
- The random forest classifier that was fitted can classify whether or not athletes have won a medal with 86% accuracy.

# Future work
- Create a user-friendly way for people to input data (i.e. their sex, nationality, age, height, weight, and a sport they are interested in) and output whether or not they are predicted to win a medal.
- Further improve the classifier, through adding additional features (e.g. previous participation in Olympics / number of spectators in sport venue / temperature on the day of the event to name just a few) and experimenting with hyperparameter tuning (which was difficult with my computer's processing power).
- Experiment with other types of models in addition to the random forest classifier.
